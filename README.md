                           Answer Of Assessment Task 01

To submit a hotfix for the "Alexâ€™s Kitchen" project, here are the steps I will follow:
1. Naming Your Branch
For a hotfix, the branch naming convention typically includes the prefix "hotfix" followed by a brief description of the issue being fixed. For example, if the hotfix is for a login bug, I might name my branch hotfix/login-bug.

2. Creating and Switching to the Hotfix Branch
Open the terminal or Git client and execute the following commands:

git checkout main             # Switch to the main branch (or production branch)
git pull origin main          # Ensure the main branch is up-to-date
git checkout -b hotfix/login-bug      # Create and switch to the new hotfix branch

3. Making Changes and Committing
Make the necessary changes to my code. Once the changes are complete, add, commit, and push them to my remote repository:

git add                      # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Fix login bug"       # Commit changes with a descriptive message
git push origin hotfix/login-bug        # Push changes to the remote repository

4. Creating a Pull Request (PR)
Navigate to my repository on GitHub (or your version control system). I should see a prompt to create a pull request for my new branch. Follow these steps:

Click on the "Compare & pull request" button.
Ensure the base branch is set to main (or the production branch) and the compare branch is my hotfix/login bug.
Provide a title and description for the PR, explaining what the hotfix addresses.
Submit the pull request.
5. Reviewing and Merging the PR
After creating the PR, it should be reviewed by other team members. Once approved, follow these steps to merge it:

In the pull request, click on the "Merge pull request" button.
Confirm the merge by clicking "Confirm merge".
Delete the hotfix branch if it is no longer needed by clicking "Delete branch".

6. Updating the Main Branch Locally
After merging the hotfix into the main branch, update the local repository:

git checkout main             # Switch to the main branch
git pull origin main          # Pull the latest changes


Summary of Commands

1. Switch to the main branch and update
--> git checkout main
--> git pull origin main

2. Create and switch to the hotfix branch
--> git checkout -b hotfix/login-bug

3. Make changes, stage, commit, and push
--> git add.
--> git commit -m "Fix login bug"
--> git push origin hotfix/login-bug

4. Create a PR on GitHub, review, and merge
5. Update the local main branch
--> git checkout main
--> git pull origin main

By following these steps, I will ensure that my hotfix is properly integrated into the production branch with minimal disruption to the ongoing development.




                           Answer Of Assessment Task 02

To tackle this problem conceptually, we'll need to iterate over each menu collection and map the menu items to their corresponding categories based on the item IDs. Here is a detailed step-by-step approach to solve this:

1.Understand the Structure:

--> Each menu collection has a type, a list of menu items, and categories.
--> Each menu item has a unique identifier (id).
--> Each category has a name and a list of menu item IDs.

2.Goal:

--> Identify which items belong to each category within each menu collection.
--> For each category in a menu collection, map the IDs in menuItems to their respective items.

3.Conceptual Approach:

--> Initialize an empty result structure to store the categorized items for each collection.
--> Loop through each collection in the array.
--> For each collection:
	--> Create a mapping of menuItems by their IDs for quick lookup.
	--> Loop through each category in the collection.
	--> For each category, retrieve the items by matching their IDs using the previously created mapping.
	--> Store the category name and the retrieved items in the result structure for the collection.
--> Return or display the result.

4.Detailed Steps:

--> Step 1: Initialize an empty result list to store categorized items for each 	collection.
--> Step 2: Loop through each menu collection.
--> Step 3: For each collection, create a dictionary mapping from menuItems array 	for O(1) look-up.
--> Step 4: Loop through each category in the collection.
--> Step 5: For each category, use the list of menuItemsIds to find and collect the corresponding menu items using the dictionary from Step 3.
--> Step 6: Store the categorized items with the category name in the result    	structure.
--> Step 7: Once all collections are processed, return the result.

By following this conceptual approach, we can efficiently map menu items to their categories for each menu collection.

NOTE: For these 3 assessments i took help from online, researched a bit and got review from a professional who have work experience with GitHub.
